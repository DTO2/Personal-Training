        <p>With so many people now working from home people are experiencing back pain more than ever and it's most likely caused by lifestyle habits of the modern working life.
            Its common knowledge that sitting at an office all day is bad for your back and now that gyms, fitness classes and sporting activity is closed, people will be feeling

       <p>according to the NHS website there are 11,117 hospital admissions directly attributed to obesity with 67% of adult men and 60% of adult women being overweight or obese. 
           losing weight is seen by most to be hard graft and not being able to eat and enjoy good food. Fat loss can be a reletively quick process with the right lifestyle

        <h2><a href="kneepain.html">  Knee Pain </a></h2>
        <img src="images/kneepain.jpg" alt="female bicep curling">

        <p>The knee takes a lot of stress and is designed to absorb the stresses place on it during activities, such as, walking, running, jumping, kicking and many other activities.
             However many people experience pain in this region which is most likely due to poor lower body biomechanics during activities resulting in excessive forces passing through the knee.
            like all joints, they can only compensate so much before the area gets injured. Pain is a good indicator to fix the problem before irreversible damage is caused.  </p>

        <h2><a href="shoulderpain.html">  Shoulder Pain and Scapula winging  </a></h2>
        <img src="images/scapula.jpg" alt="winging scapula">

        <p> Many people avoid pressing exercises due to pain associated in the shoulder. The range of motion in the shoulder and how the shoulder girdle is designed means there are a lot of exercises  
            to stress the shoulder complex doing it more harm than good. Poor thoracic posture can also contribute to the problem making the shoulder a typical place for people to experience pain.
            training to move better can help you towards functional movements like pressing again without it causing pain.

        <img src="images/plank.jpeg" alt="planking girl">

        <p>Core training is very popular because everybody wants flat toned abs. However training your abs in the common way can lead to back pain as common abs exercises involve a lot of flexion and 
            extention movements. Variations os squat and deadlifts are also associated to the core and its important to train your body in a balanced way to not cause injury.

<h1>Training</h1>

    <p>The aim of training is to get your moving pain free. 
    That's the ability of squating, lifting, pushing and pulling pain free without the need of restricting what you do.</p>

    <p>Your occupation can be the cause of some pain your experience whether your a builder who's putting your body under stress in awkward positions,
        or whether your slumped over a desk 8 hours a day or anywhere in between. The aim is to re-programme your movement patterns and strengthen your joints and muscles so you can tackle the day pain free.
    </p>

    <p>We also want to install the habit of training so your hitting the government and ACSM guidelines of training cardiovascular and strength training so a healthy 
        lifestyle becomes a long term habit.
