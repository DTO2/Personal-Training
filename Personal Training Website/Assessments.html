        <p>Muscular power, strength and endurance is required in different ratios dependant on the sport. 
    Emphasis should be tailored for your requirements and training goals. Undulating the volume, intensity and repetitions,
    with the main emphasis still in mind, will hit all fitness components and will keep training interesting and non tedious.
     undulating training loads can also help prevent fatigue as you'll be training different energy system allowing recovery inbetween each one.</p>
    
     <p>A one rep max can determine your current strength level and can be used as a baseline to programme each
        muscular fitness component</p>
